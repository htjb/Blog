# Astrophysics, Data Analysis and More

This git reposity includes codes for short projects that can be found on my blog [here](https://harrybevins.blogspot.com/).

The majority of the code uses common Python packages that are used for data analysis such as numpy, scipy, pandas and matplotlib. Unless otherwise stated in the related blog article there should not be any other dependencies.
